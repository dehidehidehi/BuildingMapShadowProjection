Title: Display shadows of tall buildings using OpenStreetMap or similar

Description: Using the sun's altitude and azimuth at a given point,
show where the tip of the shadow of tall buildings would touch the
ground.

Note: In this project, I plan to assume the Earth is locally flat, the
surface elevation doesn't change drastically, there are no major
obscurations between the building and where the shadow falls, and
that, if the shadow falls on another building, that building is small
enough that we can assume it's effectively at ground level.

Can't do this for mountains (like Mount Fuji diamond below) because
curvature of the Earth, change in surface elevation, and obscuration
are all issues, since mountains are much taller than buildings (in
general).
